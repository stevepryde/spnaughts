# NAUGHTS AND CROSSES ROBOT AI EXPERIMENT

#########################################

Goals:
* Create game runner
  - Process moves from two players
  - Score each player (perhaps some combination of win/loss and number of turns)
  - Run multiple games between two players and pick overall winner, overall score
  - Extra features for driving a genetic robot
    - Needs to create random variations and run games against them all, giving
      them all a score. Ideally each bot will run multiple games and get an
      average. Multiple games is only needed if the opponent uses variations of
      play.
    - Identify which particular variation is running, so that it can assign a
      score, and also it knows what that variation means in order to produce
      the next generation
    - Produce next generation based on winning "design"
    - Repeat several generations. This should be able to run completely
      automated.


* Create several known test bots
  - Human bot (oxymoron?) - gets input from user.
  - Random bot
  - Perfect bot (never loses, may draw)
  - Imperfect bot? (rarely loses)

* Create genetic bot
  - Perhaps several of them?
  - Designed to be extendable at random
  - Put genetic bot "DNA" in separate file, and give it a random unique code,
    so that it is possible to run the same bot twice.
  - Add separate bot generator (probably just a separate method)
    - Should be able to create new bot from scratch, or extend existing bot.

* Performance improvements
  - Only write game log once after each game.
  - Write each game log (batch?) to a sub directory, rather than a single log file.
    The log file shall be for diagnostics only
  - Create new class for running a single game, to make this easier to add
    game objects to a queue
  - Make game runs multi-threaded, and use a thread pool to run them.

Milestone reached at 2016-01-17

* Add ability to run single game against custom genetic bot (loaded from a file)
* Add ability to start a genetic run based on a custom genetic bot (loaded from file)
  - managed to implement this in the same change as above.

Milestone reached at 2016-01-17

* Is it possible to make the genetic runner do bidirectional runs, to allow
  tuning a genetic bot in both directions in a single run??
  Otherwise you end up with a genetic bot that is tuned for only one direction,
  and it may fail in the other direction (as I have already witnessed).
